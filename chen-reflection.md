What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I still sometimes forget to commit. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Was unsure of difference between fetch, pull, and merge. Guide explained that pull essentially is like fetching and merging in one go.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Had to get reminder on markdown syntax and best practices. Spaces make a difference!


What still confuses you about Git?
I feel comfortable with what we've covered so far, but I also realize there's a lot more to learn!

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Great! The guide was very relaxed which helped us work calming but quickly. I need new glasses to see small on my partners screen.
