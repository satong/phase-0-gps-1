# GPS 1.1 reflection
## Steph Tong

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I was still a little unclear about pull vs. merge vs. fetch, but this exercise helps clear that up!

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I was excited to have the opportunity to simulate a situation where a pull request had to be modified and resubmitted. I twas nice to go through that flow.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

Just some fundamentals around best practices (especially around branch naming and commit messages).

**What still confuses you about Git?**

I think I'm pretty clear on how Git works now!

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

Really enjoyed it - I didn't expect to learn so much faster and better by verbalizing what I'm doing and having people to give me feedback realtime. It really sped up the process!
